## Description

This assignment was to create a social network API using MongoDB, Express.js and Mongoose ODM.The purpose was to allow users to share thoughts, react to thoughts of thier friends and create a friends list. It was rewarding to use insomnia and see the results of the work I had done. Although it was a bit challenging to complete this assignment, I feel content with the final product.
